# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
- Ans.: I feel fairly confident with the each array method. I like the power it
  gives me in crunching lots of data quickly! :)

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
- Ans.: Well, having been in the part-time Mod 0 to now, I feel more comfortable battling
  through the uncomfortability, but it is still there! Hmm, unproductive struggle-
  Lollygagging yesterday! But I did have a nice run outside in the sun and exercises.
  Productive struggle- getting stuck at 2AM on trying HTTPS, getting denied when
  it asked for my password... And finally after taking a break, deciding to do What
  I knew I could do- create a new repository in GitHub, with a different name, as I felt comfortable doong that! At least this time I do, i didn't in the part-time Mod0.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- Ans.: I still need mor time playing with interacting on theMac, using the hot-keys etc.
  I will keep reading, practicing. :)

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- Ans.: Can I do this? Who do I think I am? Yes, I just might be able to... :)
